# VSDBabySoC Modeling
VSDBabySoC contains three IP cores `RVMYTH (RISC-V based CPU)`, `PLL` and `DAC` along with a wrapper that acts as the `SoC` and also a separate `testbench` module. Here will model and simulate the VSDBabySoC using `Iverilog`, and the results are presented using `GTKWave` tool. Initial input signals will be applied to the VSDBabySoC module to trigger the `PLL`, enabling it to generate the appropriate clock signal for the circuit. This clock signal will allow the `RVMYTH` to execute instructions stored in its instruction memory. Consequently, the register r17 will be populated with values over several cycles. These values will be utilized by the `DAC` core to produce the final output signal, referred to as `OUT`.

# Tools Required

##### VSDBabySoC Modules
1. VSDBabySoC.v
This is the primary module that combines the rvmyth, pll, and dac modules. (https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC?tab=readme-ov-file#vsdbabysoc-modeling)
* Inputs
  `reset:` This signal is used to reset the core processor of the SoC. When activated, it initializes or clears the state of the system.
  `VCO_IN:` This is the input signal for the Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), which plays a critical role in generating clock signals.
  `ENb_CP:`This is an enable signal for the charge pump (CP), which is used in Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuits to regulate the output frequency.
  `ENb_VCO:` This signal serves to enable or disable the VCO.
  `REF:`This is a reference signal utilized by the PLL for frequency comparison and stabilization.
  `VREFH:` This is the high reference voltage for the DAC. It provides the necessary voltage level that determines the range of output voltages from the DAC. 
* Outputs
  `OUT:` This is the analog output from a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
* Internal wires
  `CLK:` This is used to carry the clock signal generated by the PLL. It is crucial for synchronizing activities within the SoC.
  `RV_TO_DAC:`This is a 10-bit wide signal that connects the output signals from a RISC-V core to the input of the DAC. The width suggests that it can carry values 
   ranging from 0 to 1023 (in decimal), allowing for 1024 different values to be sent to the DAC.
