# Introduction to VSDBabySoC and Fundamentals of SoC

##### Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a compact, open-source System on Chip (SoC) that incorporates RVMYTH, a processor core based on the RISC-V architecture. The SoC includes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for precise clock generation and control, along with a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) that connects to external analog systems. This DAC allows the BabySoC to convert digital signals into analog, enabling it to communicate with devices that require analog inputs, such as televisions and mobile phones, thus facilitating audio and video output. Ultimately, this SoC, created using Sky130 technology, is designed to be a well-documented educational tool for learning and experimentation.
