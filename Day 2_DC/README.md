##### Why Delay: Water Bucket Analogy
###### Example 1

+ Delay is a function of Inflow
+ Inflow of water ----> Inflow of current
+ Therefore Faster current source is having less delay

###### Example 2
Delay = function (load capacitance)

#### Is delay of cell is constatnt?

###### Delay of gate = function (input transition, output load)

### Timing Arcs

#### Combinational Cell

+ Delay information from every input pin to every output pin which it can control is present in timing arcs
+ Example

#### Sequential Cell [D flip-flop, D latch]
