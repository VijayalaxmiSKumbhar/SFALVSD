# PVT (Process Voltage Temperature) Analysis

#### Integrated circuits are designed in such a way that they can function in a wide variety of vltages and temperatures, rather than a single voltage and temperature. These must function in variety of contexts including various conditions, electrical setup, user environments etc.

<summary>What is PVT?</summary>
<br>

* `Process (P)` : There are millions of transistors on a singke chip as we are going to lower nodes and all the transistors in a chip cannot have same properties. Process variation is the deviation in parameters of the transistors during fabrication.

* `Voltage (V)`: As we are going to lower nodes the supply voltage for a chip is also going to less. Let's say the chip is operating at 1.2 V. So, there are chances that at certain instances of time this voltage may vary.

* `Temperature (T)`: When a chip is operating, the temperature can vary throught the chip. This is due to power dissipation in MOS- transistors.

<summary>Corners of PVT?</summary>
<br>

* In order to make our chip to work after fabrication in all the possible conditions, we simulate it at different corners of process, voltage and temperature.
  
* These conditions are called corners. All these three parameters directly affect the delay of the cell.

  * `Transistor corners (fast, typical, slow)`
 
  * `Voltage`
 
  * `Temperature`

#### In this analysis SKY130PDK PVT Libs are used

* Download the libraries from `[https://github.com/efabless/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_sc_hd/tree/master/timing](https://github.com/efabless/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_sc_hd.git)'

* convert .lib files to .db format using synopsys `LC` shell

* TCL script to convert .lib file to .db format

```
# convert_lib_to_db.tcl
set lib_files_dir "/home/vijayalaxmi/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_sc_hd/timing";
set db_output_dir "/home/vijayalaxmi/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/timinglibs";
foreach lib_file [glob -nocomplain $lib_files_dir/*.lib] {
set base_name [file rootname [file tail $lib_file]]
set db_file "$db_output_dir/${base_name}.db"

if {[llength [list_libs]] > 0} {
    remove_lib [lindex [list_libs] 0]
}

read_lib $lib_file

write_lib $base_name -format db -output $db_file

if {[llength [list_libs]] > 0} {
    remove_lib [lindex [list_libs] 0]
}
}
exit

```
.db files
